# A basic RESTful API for MognoDB using Python PyMogno
This is very simple RESTful API I made as part of a class. Later I went back cleaned it up and added documentation to it using Pdoc.
This API interfaces with MongoDB using PyMongo to perform some basic CRUD operations as well as a few more complex operations on a fictional company's stock trading database.
